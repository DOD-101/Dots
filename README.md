# David's Dots

## Preamble

These config files are designed primarily for my personal use; because of this, there isn't any documentation outside of this README and comments. Additionally, because of this, it is intended for you, yes **you**, to adjust these configs to your needs and wants. In particular, eww & Hyprland will probably require the most tweaking. If you do, however, find any problems that you feel should be addressed, please do make an Issue.

These configs are all designed to work on Hyprland, but feel free to give it a shot on a different WM.

While you **can** use any of the configs without the "shared" config files, I encourage you to at least use the ctpv files.
## Required Packages
See the 'packages.txt' located in the directory for that config. The package names are all for arch/AUR.

***There is a good chance this is still missing some. Please make me aware of any you come across via an Issue.***

## Usage
1. Download all necessary packages.
2. Determine which color theme you prefer (I highly recommend blue)
3. Run ```stow -t ~ -S .``` in the appropriate directory. To undo this again run ```stow -t ~ -D .```
4. (optional/recommended) Run the above command again in the shared dir, if you wish to include those in your config as well.
5. (optional/strongly recommended) Make any changes you desire.
6. Have a look inside the ```ignored/``` directory for any other files you might want.

Had to sadly use the default Hyprland wallpaper because I can't use any [album covers](https://github.com/DOD-101/WallTune)
in the screenshots. Yay copyright!
