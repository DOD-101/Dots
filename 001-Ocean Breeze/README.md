# Ocean Breeze

<img alt="color palette" src="ignored/color-palette.svg" height="150px" />

This config is aiming to be a "lighter dark theme" and has a lot of blue, orange and yellow.

## Notes


This theme also includes all files needed to customize Firefox to fit the theme.
The browser extensions you will need are: [Sidebery](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/) & [Tabliss](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabliss/)

This theme looks great with [catppuccin cursors](https://github.com/catppuccin/cursors). I personally use the Mocha Dark ones. (currently)

### Installation steps

1. Move the ocean-breeze.zsh-theme to your ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes.
2. Symlink the `.config/userChrome` to your Firefox `chrome` dir.
3. Import the sidebery settings (`sidebery.json`) 
4. Symlink `ignored/search.desktop` to `~/.local/share/applications/search.desktop`
5. And maybe more...
